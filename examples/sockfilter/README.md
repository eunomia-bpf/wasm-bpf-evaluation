sockfilter is an example of monitoring packet and dealing with __sk_buff structure.

see [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap) for more details.

We can provide a similar developing experience as the [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap) development. Just run `make` to build the wasm binary:

```sh
make
```
